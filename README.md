## Key Features Explained

### Automatic Pagination
The editor automatically creates new pages when content exceeds the page size. This is handled by:
- Monitoring content height vs container height
- Moving overflow content to the next page
- Consolidating pages when content is deleted

### Rich Text Formatting
Uses a combination of `document.execCommand` and manual DOM manipulation:
- `document.execCommand` for basic formatting (bold, italic, underline, alignment)
- Manual span creation for fallback scenarios
- Proper event handling to maintain React state

### Chapter Management
Each chapter is stored as a separate object in state:
- Independent content for each chapter
- Automatic page creation per chapter
- Seamless switching between chapters
